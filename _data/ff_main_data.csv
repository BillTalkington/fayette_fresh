The Duda family has been farming for approximately 35 years, and have been selling their famous Super Sweet Corn along the roadside for about as long. It started in a small wagon alongside the road bordering the farm and now the farm supplies all of southwestern Pennsylvania with fresh produce all summer long at many different roadside produce stands. Duda's grows over 25 different kinds of vegetables and fruits, all of which are available at all of the roadside stands. New this year, we have greenhouses at our farm! We are selling flowers, hanging baskets, herbs, starter plants and combination deco pots. See our flyer.

Duda's produce market at the farm usually opens around Memorial Day and stays open until the day before Thanksgiving. During the month of June the farm invites everyone to come out and pick your own strawberries from the strawberry fields located next to the market. During the fall the farm hosts ""Pumpkin-pickin' Hayrides"" every weekend. After the hayride, you can also lose yourself in our huge corn mazes!"
